# aac_irish

This project combines ABAIR's Irish language voices with a trio of parsers:
    1) An Gramad√≥ir's grammar checker (an_gramadoir.py)
    2) ABAIR's genitive parser (genitive_parser.py)
    3) my own morphological parser based on AAC boards (morphological_parser.py)
    to create a self-correcting Irish language TTS API for use in AAC devices. 

Three pages are available:
1) Get voice of choice where the inputted text has been corrected.
2) Get correction of text alone.
3) Get hand-tuned parameterised hts voice.
