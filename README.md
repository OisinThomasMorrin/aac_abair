# aac_irish

This project combines ABAIR's Irish language voices with An Gramad√≥ir's grammar checker to create a self-correcting Irish language TTS API for use in AAC devices. 

Three pages are available:
1) Get voice of choice where the inputted text has been corrected.
2) Get correction of text alone.
3) Get hand-tuned parameterised hts voice.
